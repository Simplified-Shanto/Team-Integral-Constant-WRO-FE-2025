Our experience with the TT motor says that, it's not perfect for the purpose because, it gets hot as the practice run keeps lengthening. 
-> There's problem in the startup, motor starts slower than expected and after few seconds, it gains the proper speed. This is a problem. It might be a motor driver issue too.
